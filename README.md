Landscape Profile is a conservation planning tool for helping planners analyze prospective developments from the perspective of cumulative impacts on the landscape and landscape connectivity. The tool has been developed in collaboration with planners in British Columbia, and is currently in the beta testing phase of development. The Conservation Planning Tool (LPT) is an initiative led by the [Okanagan Collaborative Conservation Program (OCCP)](https://okcp.ca/).

## Design Goals

The CPT has been developed with the following Design Goals in mind:

1. Scalability: Want a tool that can scale to new and more complex models for assessing connectivity and cumulative impacts and new datasets 
2. Transparency:  Clear documentation of data and models and how computations are performed
3. Open Source: Use open source libraries as much as possible, allow for extendibility with a flexible modelling framework
4. Use-Case Driven: Maintain a narrow focus on a clear target use case, supporting evaluation of metrics in relation to development proposals
5. Iterative Feedback: Work with planners and stakeholders early and often to incorporate feedback into tool design and approach


## Core Concepts
