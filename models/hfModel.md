## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

[//]: # (This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations)

Model results are constrained by the accuracy of input data sources. Error may be introduced through plan polygons or base layers.


## Recommendations

[//]: # (This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations.)


# Technical Details


## Preprocessing
